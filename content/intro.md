Welcome to my experiment in learning in public. A tip of the cap to:

- [Scott Hanselman](https://hanselminutes.com/) for the motivation to start this
- [Talk Python Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/) for the Pelican starter to get this going
- [Jonathan Coulton](https://www.jonathancoulton.com/) for inspiring me to be both functional _and_ elegant
